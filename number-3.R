Interpretation of Results:
#1. QQ Plot Before Removing Outliers:
#If the points deviate significantly from the straight line, 
#it indicates that residuals are not normally distributed,
#possibly due to influential outliers.



#2.QQ Plot After Removing Outliers:
#If the plot becomes more linear, it suggests that removing the outliers improved normality.
#If thereâ€™s little or no change, the outliers may not have affected normality significantly.
#If the plot worsens, the removed points might not have been true outliers, and they could be important for the model.
